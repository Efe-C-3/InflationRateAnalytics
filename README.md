# Passion Project: Record high inflation rate in history

While the pandemic environment keeps covering the news headline with new variants of Covid-19, the record high inflation rates of the last three decades made it to the news and got the attention of politicians as well as some consumers. 

Simply, inflation is a general increase in prices of goods and services sold in a year, such as food, electronics, transportation and housing. Such an economic indicator has a direct effect on peopleâ€™s life on a daily basis.  It means, with inflation, people end up paying more for the same products year over year. 

In my passion project, the goal is to project price changes in different product categories and different business sectors in the last 10 years while looking for a relation in price changes of raw and final products and to see if there is a specific product category that may drive such rates up and that is significantly higher than others.

For this project, I will download a dataset from Common Crawl website, use Python and SQL languages, Pandas and statistics framework, Spark and AWS data pipeline technologies, VS Code visualization tool and Heroku web platform to present analytics publicly.
